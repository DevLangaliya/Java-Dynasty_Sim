# APCSA_final_project
Final project from AP Computer Science A. I took this class in the 2022-2023 school year. Used Java.

You get to choose a team to control for a season, and can improve your team by trading with other teams, and manage weekly trade offers from other teams.
When it's game time, watch the action unfold in real time as you see field position and the play-by-play happen. 
After the game, don't forget to check out the player stats section, and see how players from around the league have performed.
